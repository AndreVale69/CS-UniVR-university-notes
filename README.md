# University study notes

This repository contains all my university notes.\
\
Most of the notes are written in $\LaTeX$ but some are still in Word (Microsoft) :disappointed:.\
\
In this rep. you can find also some code excersices that I wrote (e.g. Java $\rightarrow$ Software Engineer).\
\
At last, the whole language repository is in Italian because I studied in Italy.

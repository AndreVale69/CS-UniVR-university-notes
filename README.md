# University notes

This repository contains all my university notes.

Most of the notes are written in $\LaTeX$ but some are still in Word (Microsoft) :disappointed:.

I completed my Bachelor's degree in February 2024.

At last, the whole language repository is in Italian because I studied in Italy, Computer Science, Verona.
